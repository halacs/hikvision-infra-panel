# Infra panel for Hikvision DS-2CD2132-I

However, I designed this infra panel for my Hikvision DS-2CD2132-I cameras, it might fit for other Hikvision models too. I have no experience with other models yet. If you have please let me know, either via a pull request or in any other way. Thanks!

I noticed that I drawn my PCB maybe with too thin wirings so be careful with the lines near to the edges of the PCB. I cut one line off while I was placing the parts...

# Parts

- 30 pcs 3mm 850 nm infrared LEDs
