# Infra panel designs Hikvision IP cameras

After a few months/years infra LEDs are gone and need to be replaced. Since there are no cheap replacement boards on the internet I made my own based on the original factory infra panel.

I used KiCad 8.0 and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. I add the final gerber finels and some pictures as well to the repository.
